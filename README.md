# win10_config

I'm basically sick and tired of having multiple 'windows batch installers' to get a fresh Windows 10 machine set-up to my liking or having to configure it to a particular state in a 'good enough' state for friends and family.

The aim of this repository is just to provide a quick set of commonly used tools that configure up multiple different desktop machines.

# WIP:
- Use publically available vagrant box to test this on easily
	- Potentially use box-starter if easier

# TO-DO:
- Add default 'everything' shortcut of win+alt+spacebar
- Add ahk scripts to Windows10 'startup' folder. Changed with the creators update.
- Add the Reddit Wallpaper changer.
- Make taskbar appear on right side of monitor.
